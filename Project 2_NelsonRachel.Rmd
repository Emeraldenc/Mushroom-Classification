## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r df}
df <- read.csv("D:/College/DSC680/Project 2/df_dummy.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r dtree, echo=FALSE}
### Decision Tree (basic)
### Decision Tree (basic)
train<-read.csv("D:/College/DSC680/Project 2/df_dummy.csv", header=TRUE)
y<-as.factor(train[,2])
x<-train[,3:92]
fit<-rpart(y~.,x)
sum(y!=predict(fit,x,type="class"))/length(y)
fancyRpartPlot(fit)
fit
```
